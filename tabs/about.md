I'm an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt). Currently a PhD student at the [Security & Privacy Research Unit](https://secpriv.tuwien.ac.at/) at TU Wien.
I am interested in Computer Security, Reverse Engineering and all things *low-level*. In my free time, I play CTF competitions (Capture The Flag) and try to learn as much as I can about my main interests: **Binary Exploitation**, **Reverse Engineering** and **Web Security**.


I have always been fascinated by computers and started programming at age 16, while in high school and have been doing it ever since. At first, I was most interested in Game and Graphics Programming as well as developing projects for the Arduino.  
At the end of my first year in university I discovered Cybersecurity and the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and I was instantly hooked! Who doesn't want to be a "hacker", right?  

I am a member of the [Security Team @Técnico]() student group/CTF Team and take every chance I get to play the competitions and improve my skills.

# Experience
- From January to November of 2019 I was a Java Developer at the [Computer and Network Services](https://si.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).  
During this time, I worked on the [SmartSigner](https://smartsigner.eu/) project helping with technology migrations and integration of new features.

- Gave two lectures **STT** internal lectures about the *Glibc's Heap basics and how to exploit it*.

- Played for **STT** in both online and on-site finals including [CSAW'20](https://ctftime.org/event/1190) and [PRO CTF FINALS - HITB+](https://ctftime.org/event/1524/)

- Member of team **Portugal** in the [European Cyber Security Challenge 2021](https://ecsc2021.cz/), where we achieved Portugal's best ranking to date.

- Co-author of [ICISSP 2022](https://icissp.scitevents.org/?y=2022) paper [Systematic Analysis of Programming Languages and Their Execution Environments for Spectre Attacks](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_304458.pdf)

- Co-author of [S&P 2023](https://sp2023.ieee-security.org/) paper [WebSpec: Towards Machine-Checked Analysis of Browser Security MechanismsWebSpec ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01649) (arxiv)(to be published in May 2023)
