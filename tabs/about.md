I'm a Computer Science and Engineering MsC student at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).   
I am interested in Computer Security, Reverse Engineering and all things *low-level*. When not doing coursework I play security CTF competitions (Capture The Flag) and try to learn as much as I can about my main interests: **Binary Exploitation** and **Reverse Engineering**.


I have always been fascinated by computers and started programming at age 16, while in high school and have been doing it ever since. At first, I was most interested in Game and Graphics Programming as well as developing projects for the Arduino.  
At the end of my first year in university I discovered Cybersecurity and the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and I was instantly hooked! Who doesn't want to be a "hacker", right?  
I am also a GNU/Linux enthusiast!

I'm currently a member of the [Security Team @Técnico]() student group/CTF Team and take every chance I get to play the competitions and to learn more about the fascinating field that is Cybersecurity.

# Experience
From January to November of 2019 I was a Java Developer at the [Computer and Network Services](https://si.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) of [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).  
During this time, I worked on the [SmartSigner](https://smartsigner.eu/) project helping with technology migrations and integration of new features.

I also gave a lecture about the *Glibc's Heap basics and how to exploit it* on one of [STT's](https://sectt.github.io/) meetings.

# Technical Skills
I regularly practice **Reverse Engineering** and do a lot of research in the area of **Binary Exploitation**.

My favorite languages are the ones I'm most proficient at, which are C/C++ and Python.   
Thanks to the versatility of Python, I tend to use it for everything I want to automate quickly, ranging from scripts for solving CTF challenges to full fledged web apps.

## Tools:
- Reverse Engineering
    - IDA Pro
    - Ghidra
    - Cutter/radare2
- Programming and Scripting
    - Python
    - C/C++
    - Bash
    - x86
    - Java
